Community
=========
The QCArchive is an open community sponsored by `The Molecular Sciences
Software Institute <https://molssi.org>`_. However, this is a community-driven
project which requires feature requests, user feedback, and code support.
There are a variety of ways to help support the QCArchive project as seen
below.

Discussion
----------

- QCArchive Slack is a great place to get feedback and advice from the community. |join_slack_upper|_ to get started.
- The QCArchive GitHub repositories contain future roadmaps, current code updates, and a list of issues that are being worked and provide an excellent overview of the development status of the project.

Work with us!
-------------

The QCArchive project is actively looking for early collaborations to use our
tools, help us shake out the bugs, and be evangelist within the computational
molecular science community for this code ecosystem. In return you will receive
the following benefits:

- Work directly with MolSSI Software Scientist who will discuss your problem and provide ideas.
- Develop the requirements and potential solutions for your use case within the QCArchive ecosystem.
- Setup monthly meetings to ensure your project stays on track.
- Highlight your project within the QCArchive ecosystem.

If you are interested in working with us, please send an email to
`QCArchive@molssi.org <mailto:qcarchive@molssi.org>`_ and we will set up a meeting
to discuss specifics.

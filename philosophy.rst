Software Philosophy
===================
The QCArchive is an open community sponsored by `The Molecular Sciences
Software Institute <https://molssi.org>`_. However, this is a community-driven
project which requires feature requests, user feedback, and code support.
There are a variety of ways to help support the QCArchive project as seen
below.

A multilayered ecosystem
------------------------

The QCArchive ecosystem is made up of a series of layers to suit a variety of different use cases. The QCArchive ecosystem consists of the following:
Support libraries for quantum chemistry, from physical constants to abstract program execution engines.A distributed task engine for running and organizing arbitrary computations.
The MolSSI QCArchive instance for the community to share and archive data.
High-level organizational layers known as Collections to compute and analyize commonly found operations.
See our getting started page for help on finding the right place to start:

We support software best practices
----------------------------------

QCArchive's projects are all based on the same software best practices. Both users and developers can follow the code structure between all of the projects, and these practices are provided back to the community through the external projects like the CMS-Cookiecutter. This cookiecutter supports:

- Continuous integration with automated testing and testing coverage
- Automated versionsing and package distribution via Conda-Forge and PyPI
- Code quality and linting checks for beutiful code
- Automatic package organization and documentation setup

The cookiecutter is available for all Python projects! Check it out `here <https://github.com/MolSSI/cookiecutter-cms>`_!

Code quality is of utmost importance
------------------------------------

The quality of the QCArchive code is checked through rigorous continuous integration, code linters, and test coverage tools which help reduce the chance that bugs are introduced. We take data accuracy very seriously and all results and calculations are versioned, provenance tracked, and will be preserved over any updates of the database.
